% NOTE!!!! 9/27/19 THIS CODE SHOULD NOT BE USED BY MEMBERS OF  BBML.
% It is intended for collaborators who do not have CT slices from CTan and
% have instead used CTGeom or potentially some other method to find I and c.
% If somehting other than CTGeom was used, parts of the code need to be 
% modified. corrected issue with geometry. See note below.

% Code is for femur and now allows this to work for 3 or 4 point bending 
% which is hard coded.
%
% AGB adapted on 7/24/15 to not zero the load and displacement when you choose
% the start point due to problems with rolling during testing. Instead, the
% program will use this point, then perform a linear regression to take
% this back to 0,0

% Written by Joey Wallace, July 2012 to work with test resources system.

% Edited by Max Hammond Sept. 2014 Changed the output from a csv 
% file to an xls spreadsheet that included a title row. Code written by
% Alycia Berman was added into the CTgeom section of the code to subtract
% out the scale bars that appear in some CT images. Used while loop to
% semi-batch process. Hard coded in initial values like bendtype, slice
% number, and voxel size because each will be held constant within a study.
% Added the option to smooth or not during Testing Configuration. Smoothed
% using a moving average with a span of 10. Added a menu in case points
% need to be reselected.

% This is a comprehensive program that reads in geometric and mechanical
% information to calculate force/displacement and stress/strain from 
% BENDING MECHANICAL TESTS IN THE FEMUR ONLY (3 OR 4 POINT)

% This program reads raw mechanical data from the Bose system
% from a a file named "specimen name.csv". It assumes that mechanical specimen
% names are written as "ID#_RF" or "ID#_LF". For femora, the assumption is that
% bending was about the ML axis with the anterior surface in tension.
%  
% The program adjusts for system compliance and then uses beam bending
% theory to convert force-displacement data to theoretical stress-strain
% values.  Mechanical properties are calculated in both domains and output
% to a file "specimen name_mechanics.csv".  It also outputs a figure
% showing the load-displacement and stress-strain curves with significant
% points marked.
